## Introduction

Welcome to the Simon Game! This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic memory game, where you have to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the computer. This README will guide you through the game, its features, and how to set it up.

## Game Description

The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that tests your ability to remember and repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The game presents a sequence that starts with a single color/sound and progressively becomes longer and more challenging as you successfully complete each level.

## How to Play

1. **Start**: Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. **Remember**: Pay attention to the sequence of colors and sounds played by the computer.
3. **Repeat**: Click the colors in the same order as they were presented by the computer.
4. **Level Up**: If you successfully repeat the sequence, you will advance to the next level.
5. **Mistake**: If you make a mistake in the sequence, the game will indicate the correct sequence, and you'll have to start again from the first level.
6. **Win**: Continue playing and trying to beat your previous high score.
